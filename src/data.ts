export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How does the AI Dangerous Content Detection work?",
    answer: "Our cloud-native AI scans incoming URLs, search terms, and network packets at the browser level. Using natural language processing, it classifies risk patterns in real time (e.g., cyberbullying cues, phishing, malware triggers, adult content) and instantly notifies parents while blocking the harmful resource, without violating child privacy in private messaging apps."
  },
  {
    question: "Is call & SMS monitoring legally permitted?",
    answer: "Yes, call and SMS activity analysis is permitted on device operating systems where parental permission is explicitly configured (such as Android and dedicated tablet settings). Guardian AI highlights metadata trends (suspicious phone numbers, late-night texting) to protect children while respecting legal privacy standards."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Interest & Talent Discovery engine?",
    answer: "Instead of just acting as a digital lock, our platform aims to empower child growth. When your child spends time browsing educational subjects (like math puzzles or coding compilers), our AI analyzes their learning patterns and constructs a customized talent map. This assists parents in identifying career interests, offering recommendations for courses, books, and science clubs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do Smart Safe Zones alert parents?",
    answer: "Using smart geofencing, Guardian AI establishes circular boundary rings around frequently visited places (home, school, soccer field). If the device enters or leaves these zones at unscheduled times, parents receive immediate silent push notifications with real-time map updates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I try Guardian AI for free?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Every plan includes a 7-day high-tier free trial so you can experience our advanced AI features, weekly reports, and Family AI Assistant."
